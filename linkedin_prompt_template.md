There's a myth in Switzerland: To hire a Non-EU candidate you must prove that none else in EU can do the job.

That's just not true.

Every week I see strong candidates get rejected because companies are scared off by outdated information. In many cases you don't have to prove anything at all.

Here are two common exceptions every Swiss employer should know:

1. Swiss University graduate in High-Demand Field: If the candidate graduated in a field of high economic value to Switzerland (tech, health, engineering etc.), you don't need to show your hiring efforts. (literally almost all ETH/EPFL graduates fall under that category).

2. Jobs with Proven Skill Shortages: There's even a public list of these roles. If your role is on it, again no hiring efforts is needed in the work permit application.
In both cases, if done right, hiring can be almost as fast as for EU citizens.

And even when a labor market test is required, here's what it really means:
You don't have to prove no single human being in Europe can do the job. Just that none of the applicants to your job ad was suitable.

Don't let myths disadvantage your team's growth.
