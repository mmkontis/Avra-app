# LinkedIn Post: Switzerland's Builders Community

## Post Content

There's a perception that Silicon Valley has the monopoly on world-class builders.

That's just not true.

After 3 years building in Switzerland's tech ecosystem, I've discovered something remarkable: Switzerland quietly hosts Europe's most sophisticated builders community.

Here's why Swiss builders are different:

**1. Quality over Quantity Mindset**
While other hubs chase unicorn valuations, Swiss builders focus on sustainable, profitable businesses. Companies like Logitech, ABB, and Nestl√© didn't happen by accident - they're products of a culture that values long-term thinking.

**2. Cross-Industry Innovation**
Where else do you find fintech founders collaborating with pharma engineers and robotics experts? ETH Zurich and EPFL create this unique cross-pollination that doesn't exist elsewhere in Europe.

**3. Access to Capital Without the Hype**
Swiss builders have access to patient capital from family offices, banks, and institutional investors who understand deep tech. No need for flashy pitches - just solid fundamentals.

**4. Regulatory Sandbox Advantage**
Switzerland's progressive regulatory approach lets builders experiment with crypto, AI, and biotech in ways that would take years of approval elsewhere in Europe.

**5. The "Swiss Network Effect"**
In a country of 8.7 million people, the builder community is incredibly tight-knit. One introduction can change your entire trajectory.

The proof? Switzerland has the highest density of deep tech startups per capita in Europe, and the highest average exit valuations.

If you're a builder looking for your next move, don't overlook Switzerland.

The mountains aren't the only thing that's elevated here.
